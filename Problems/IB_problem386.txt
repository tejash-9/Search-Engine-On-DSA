b'You are given a directed graph with A vertices and M edges.\nYou are given an array B with dimensions M x 2, where each row denotes a directed edge from Bi, 0 to Bi, 1.\nYou need to find if there exists a mother vertex in the given graph. Return 1 if it exists, otherwise 0.\nA mother vertex is defined as a vertex from which all the vertices in the graph are accessible by a directed path.'
