b'The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n\xc3\x97n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.\n\nGiven an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.\nEach solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens\xe2\x80\x99 placement, where \'Q\' and \'.\' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.\nFor example,\nThere exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:\n[\n [".Q..",  // Solution 1\n  "...Q",\n  "Q...",\n  "..Q."],\n\n ["..Q.",  // Solution 2\n  "Q...",\n  "...Q",\n  ".Q.."]\n]\n\n\n'
