b"You are given an integer array A.\nYou have to find the number of occurences of each number.\nReturn an array containing only the occurences with the smallest value's occurence first.\nFor example, A = [4, 3, 3], you have to return an array [2, 1], where 2 is the number of occurences for element 3, \nand 1 is the number of occurences for element 4. But, 2 comes first because 3 is smaller than 4."
