b'Given a sorted array A consisting of duplicate elements.\n Your task is to remove all the duplicates and return a sorted array of distinct elements consisting of all distinct elements present in A.\nBut, instead of returning an answer array, you have to rearrange the given array in-place such that it resembles what has been described above.\nHence, return a single integer, the index(1-based) till which the answer array would reside in the given array A.\nNote: This integer is the same as the number of integers remaining inside A had we removed all the duplicates.\nLook at the example explanations for better understanding.\n\n\n\n'
