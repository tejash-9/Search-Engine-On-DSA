b'Given an array of integers A, find and return the peak element in it.\nAn array element is peak if it is NOT smaller than its neighbors. \nFor corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor. \nFor example, for input array {5, 10, 20, 15}, 20 is the only peak element.\nFollowing corner cases give better idea about the problem.\n1) If input array is sorted in strictly increasing order, the last element is always a peak element. \nFor example, 5 is peak element in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n2) If input array is sorted in strictly decreasing order, the first element is always a peak element. \n10 is the peak element in {10, 9, 8, 7, 6}.\n\n\nNote: It is guranteed that the answer is unique.\n\nInput Format\nThe only argument given is the integer array A.\n\n\nOutput Format\nReturn the peak element.\n\n\nConstraints\n1 <= length of the array <= 100000\n1 <= A[i] <= 10^9 \n\n\nFor Example\nInput 1:\n    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nOutput 1:\n    5\n\nInput 2:\n    A = [5, 17, 100, 11]\nOutput 2:\n    100\n\n\n'
