b'Given an array A with non negative numbers, divide the array into two parts such that the average of both the parts is equal.\nReturn both parts (If exist). If there is no solution. return an empty list.\nNOTE:\nIf a solution exists, you should return a list of exactly 2 lists of integers A and B which follow the following condition :\nnumElements in A <= numElements in B\nIf numElements in A = numElements in B, then A is lexicographically smaller than B ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order )\nIf multiple solutions exist, return the solution where length(A) is minimum. If there is still a tie, return the one where A is lexicographically smallest.\nArray will contain only non negative numbers.'
