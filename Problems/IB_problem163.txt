b'Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.\nNote: The test cases are generated in the following format (use the following format to use See Expected Output option):\nFirst integer N is the number of nodes.\nThen, N intgers follow denoting the label (or hash) of the N nodes.\nThen, N2 integers following denoting the adjacency matrix of a graph, where Adj[i][j] = 1 denotes presence of an undirected edge between the ith and jth node, O otherwise.\n\n'
