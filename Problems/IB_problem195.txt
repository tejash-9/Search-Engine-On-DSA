b"Given an array of integers, A of length N, find out the maximum sum sub-array of non negative numbers from A.\nThe sub-array should be contiguous i.e., a sub-array created by choosing the second and fourth element and skipping the third element is invalid.\nMaximum sub-array is defined in terms of the sum of the elements in the sub-array.\nFind and return the required subarray.\nNOTE:  If there is a tie, then compare with segment's length and return segment which has maximum length.\nIf there is still a tie, then return the segment with minimum starting index.\n"
