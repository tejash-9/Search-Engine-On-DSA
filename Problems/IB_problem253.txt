b'There are A islands and there are M bridges connecting them. Each bridge has some cost attached to it.\nWe need to find bridges with minimal cost such that all islands are connected.\nIt is guaranteed that input data will contain at least one possible scenario in which all islands are connected with each other.\nInput Format:\nThe first argument contains an integer, A, representing the number of islands.\nThe second argument contains an 2-d integer matrix, B, of size M x 3:\n    => Island B[i][0] and B[i][1] are connected using a bridge of cost B[i][2].\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer representing the minimal cost required.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= A, M <= 6e4\n1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= A\n1 <= B[i][2] <= 1e3\n\n\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    A = 4\n    B = [   [1, 2, 1]\n            [2, 3, 4]\n            [1, 4, 3]\n            [4, 3, 2]\n            [1, 3, 10]  ]\n\nOutput 1:\n    6\n\nExplanation 1:\n    We can choose bridges (1, 2, 1), (1, 4, 3) and (4, 3, 2), where the total cost incurred will be (1 + 3 + 2) = 6.\n\nInput 2:\n    A = 4\n    B = [   [1, 2, 1]\n            [2, 3, 2]\n            [3, 4, 4]\n            [1, 4, 3]   ]\n\nOutput 2:\n    6\n\nExplanation 2:\n    We can choose bridges (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2) and (1, 4, 3), where the total cost incurred will be (1 + 2 + 3) = 6.\n\n\n'
