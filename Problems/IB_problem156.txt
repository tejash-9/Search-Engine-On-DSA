b'Suppose a sorted array A is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.\n(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).\nFind the minimum element.\nThe array will not contain duplicates.\n\n\nNOTE 1: Also think about the case when there are duplicates. Does your current solution work? How does the time complexity change?*\n\n\nPROBLEM APPROACH:\nNote: If you know the number of times the array is rotated, then this problem becomes trivial. If the number of rotation is x, then minimum element is A[x].\nLets look at how we can calculate the number of times the array is rotated.\nComplete solution in the hints.\n'
