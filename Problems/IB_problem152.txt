b'There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively.\nFind the median of the two sorted arrays ( The median of the array formed by merging both the arrays ).\nThe overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).\nSample Input\nA : [1 4 5]\nB : [2 3]\n\n\n\nSample Output\n3\n\n\n\nNOTE: IF the number of elements in the merged array is even, then the median is the average of n / 2 th and n/2 + 1th element. \nFor example, if the array is [1 2 3 4], the median is (2 + 3) / 2.0 = 2.5\n\n'
