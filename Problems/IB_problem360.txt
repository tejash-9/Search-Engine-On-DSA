b'Given an directed graph having A nodes labelled from 1 to A containing M edges given by matrix B of size M x 2such that there is a edge directed from node\nB[i][0] to node B[i][1].\nFind whether a path exists from node 1 to node A.\nReturn 1 if path exists else return 0.\nNOTE:\n\nThere are no self-loops in the graph.\nThere are no multiple edges between two nodes.\nThe graph may or may not be connected.\nNodes are numbered from 1 to A.\nYour solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.\n\n\n'
