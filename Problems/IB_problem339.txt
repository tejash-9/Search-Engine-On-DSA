b'You are given A eggs, and you have access to a building with B floors from 1 to B.\nEach egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again.\nYou know that there exists a floor C with 0 <= C <= B  such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than C will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor C will not break.\nEach move, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor X (with 1 <= X <= B). \nYour goal is to know with certainty what the value of C is.\nWhat is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what C is, regardless of the initial value of C\n\n\n'
