b'You are given the following :\n\nA positive number N\nHeights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue\nInfronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P)  that gives the number of persons who are taller than P and standing in front of P\n\nYou need to return  list of actual order of persons\xe2\x80\x99s height\nConsider that heights will be unique\nExample\nInput : \nHeights: 5 3 2 6 1 4\nInFronts: 0 1 2 0 3 2\n\n\nOutput : \nactual order is: 5 3 2 1 6 4 \n\n\nSo, you can see that for the person with height 5, there is no one taller than him who is in front of him, and hence Infronts has 0 for him.\nFor person with height 3, there is 1 person ( Height : 5 ) in front of him who is taller than him.\nYou can do similar inference for other people in the list.\n'
