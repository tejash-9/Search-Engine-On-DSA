b"Given an array of strings, return all groups of strings that are anagrams. Represent a group by a list of integers representing the index in the original list. Look at the sample case for clarification.\n\nAnagram : a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as 'spar', formed from 'rasp'\n\n\nNote:  All inputs will be in lower-case.\n\nExample :\nInput : cat dog god tca\nOutput : [[1, 4], [2, 3]]\n\n\ncat and tca are anagrams which correspond to index 1 and 4. \ndog and god are another set of anagrams which correspond to index 2 and 3.\nThe indices are 1 based ( the first element has index 1 instead of index 0).\n\nOrdering of the result : You should not change the relative ordering of the words / phrases within the group. Within a group containing A[i] and A[j], A[i] comes before A[j] if i < j.\n\n"
