b'\nYou are given an integer A which represents the length of a permutation. A permutation is an array of length A where all the elements occur exactly once and in any order. For example, [3, 4, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3] are examples of valid permutations while [1, 2, 2], [2] are not.\nYou are also given an integer B. If all the permutation of length A are sorted lexicographically, return the Bth permutation.\n'
