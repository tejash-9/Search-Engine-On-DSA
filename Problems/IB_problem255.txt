b'Given a binary tree A consisting of N nodes, return a 2-D array denoting the vertical order traversal of A.\nGo through the example and image for more details.\nNOTE:\n\nIf 2 or more Tree Nodes shares the same vertical level then the one with earlier occurence in the level-order traversal of tree comes first in the output.\nRow 1 of the output array will be the nodes on leftmost vertical line similarly last row of the output array will be the nodes on the rightmost vertical line.\n\n\n\n\n'
