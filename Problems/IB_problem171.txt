b'Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.\nExample :\nGiven\n\n         1\n        / \\\n       2   5\n      / \\   \\\n     3   4   6\n\n\nThe flattened tree should look like:\n   1\n    \\\n     2\n      \\\n       3\n        \\\n         4\n          \\\n           5\n            \\\n             6\n\n\nNote that the left child of all nodes should be NULL.\n'
