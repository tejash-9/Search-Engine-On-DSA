b'The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)\nP.......A........H.......N\n..A..P....L....S....I...I....G\n....Y.........I........R\n\n\nAnd then read line by line: PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\nWrite the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:\nstring convert(string text, int nRows);\nconvert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"\n\n\n**Example 2 : **\nABCD, 2 can be written as\nA....C\n...B....D\n\n\nand hence the answer would be ACBD.\n'
