b"Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an,\nwhere each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).\n'n' vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).\nFind two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.\nYour program should return an integer which corresponds to the maximum area of water that can be contained ( Yes, we know maximum area instead of maximum volume sounds weird. But this is 2D plane we are working with for simplicity ).\n\nNote: You may not slant the container.\n\nExample :\nInput : [1, 5, 4, 3]\nOutput : 6\n\nExplanation : 5 and 3 are distance 2 apart. So size of the base = 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. \nSo total area = 3 * 2 = 6\n\n\n"
