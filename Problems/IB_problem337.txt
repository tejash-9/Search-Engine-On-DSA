b'Given an undirected tree with an even number of nodes. Consider each connection between a parent and child node to be an edge.\nYou need to remove maximum number of these edges, such that the disconnected subtrees that remain each have an even number of nodes.\nReturn the maximum number of edges you can remove.\n\n'
