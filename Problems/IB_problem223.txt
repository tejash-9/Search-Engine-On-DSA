b'You are given a sequence of black and white horses, and a set of K stables numbered 1 to K. You have to accommodate the horses into the stables in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n\nYou fill the horses into the stables preserving the relative order of horses. For instance, you cannot put horse 1 into stable 2 and horse 2 into stable 1. You have to preserve the ordering of the horses.\nNo stable should be empty and no horse should be left unaccommodated.\nTake the product (number of white horses * number of black horses) for each stable and take the sum of all these products. This value should be the minimum among all possible accommodation arrangements\n\n\nExample:\n\nInput: {WWWB} , K = 2\nOutput: 0\n\nExplanation:\nWe have 3 choices {W, WWB}, {WW, WB}, {WWW, B}\nfor first choice we will get 1*0 + 2*1 = 2.\nfor second choice we will get 2*0 + 1*1 = 1.\nfor third choice we will get 3*0 + 0*1 = 0.\n\nOf the 3 choices, the third choice is the best option. \n\n\n\nIf a solution is not possible, then return -1\n'
