b'Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.\n\nHeight-balanced binary tree  : is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.\n\nReturn 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem\nExample :\nInput : \n          1\n         / \\\n        2   3\n\nReturn : True or 1 \n\nInput 2 : \n         3\n        /\n       2\n      /\n     1\n\nReturn : False or 0 \n         Because for the root node, left subtree has depth 2 and right subtree has depth 0. \n         Difference = 2 > 1. \n\n\n'
