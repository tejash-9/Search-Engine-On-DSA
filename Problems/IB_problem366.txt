b'Given a binary tree denoted by root node A and a leaf node B from this tree.\n It is known that all nodes connected to a given node (left child, right child and parent) get burned in 1 second. Then all the nodes which are connected through one intermediate get burned in 2 seconds, and so on.\nYou need to find the minimum time required to burn the complete binary tree.\n\n'
