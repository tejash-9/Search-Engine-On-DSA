b'For Given Number N find if its COLORFUL number or not\nReturn 0/1\nCOLORFUL number:\nA number can be broken into different contiguous sub-subsequence parts. \nSuppose, a number 3245 can be broken into parts like 3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245. \nAnd this number is a COLORFUL number, since product of every digit of a contiguous subsequence is different\n\n\nExample:\nN = 23\n2 3 23\n2 -> 2\n3 -> 3\n23 -> 6\nthis number is a COLORFUL number since product of every digit of a sub-sequence are different. \n\nOutput : 1\n\n\n'
