b'You are given a string, S, and a list of words, L, that are all of the same length.\nFind all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once and without any intervening characters.\nExample :\nS: "barfoothefoobarman"\nL: ["foo", "bar"]\n\n\nYou should return the indices: [0,9].\n(order does not matter).\n'
