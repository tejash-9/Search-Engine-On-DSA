b'Given an integer array A of size N. You have to merge all the elements of the array into one with the minimum possible cost.\nThe rule for merging is as follows:\n\n Choose any two adjacent elements of the array with values say X and Y and merge them into a single element with value (X + Y) paying a total cost of (X + Y).\nReturn the minimum possible cost of merging all elements.\n\n'
