b'Given a tree with N nodes labelled from 1 to N.\nEach node is either good or bad denoted by binary array A of size N where if A[i] is 1 then ithnode is good else if A[i] is \n0 then ith node is bad.\nAlso the given tree is rooted at node 1 and you need to tell the number of root to leaf paths in the tree that contain not more than C good nodes.\nNOTE:\n\nEach edge in the tree is bi-directional.\n\n\n\n'
