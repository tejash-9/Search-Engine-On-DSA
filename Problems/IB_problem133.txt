b'Given the array of strings A, you need to find the longest string S which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.\nLongest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 and S2.\nFor Example: longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".\n\n\n\n'
