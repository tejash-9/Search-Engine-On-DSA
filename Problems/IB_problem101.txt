b'Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers out of 1 2 3 ... n.\nMake sure the combinations are sorted.\nTo elaborate,\n\nWithin every entry, elements should be sorted. [1, 4] is a valid entry while [4, 1] is not.\nEntries should be sorted within themselves.\n\nExample :\nIf n = 4 and k = 2, a solution is:\n[\n  [1,2],\n  [1,3],\n  [1,4],\n  [2,3],\n  [2,4],\n  [3,4],\n]\n\n\n\nWarning : DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR GENERATING COMBINATIONS.\nExample : itertools.combinations in python.\nIf you do, we will disqualify your submission retroactively and give you penalty points.\n\n'
