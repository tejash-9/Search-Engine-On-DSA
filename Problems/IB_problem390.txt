b'You are given an integer array A of length N.\nFor every integer X in the array, you have to find out the number of integers Y, \nsuch that 1 <= Y <= X, and the number of divisors of Y is a power of 2.\nFor example, 6 has the following divisors - [1, 2, 3, 6]. This is equal to 4, which is a power of 2.\nOn the other hand, 9 has the following divisors [1, 3, 9] which is 3, which is not a power of 2.\nReturn an array containing the answer for every X in the given array.'
