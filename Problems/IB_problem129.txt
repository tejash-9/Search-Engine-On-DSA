b'Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array\nGiven a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element can appear atmost twice and return the new length.\nDo not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.\nNote that even though we want you to return the new length, make sure to change the original array as well in place\nFor example,\nGiven input array A = [1,1,1,2],\nYour function should return length = 3, and A is now [1,1,2].\n'
