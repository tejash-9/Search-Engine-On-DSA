b'Given a string A of size N, find and return the longest palindromic substring in A.\nSubstring of string A is A[i...j] where 0 <= i <= j < len(A)\nPalindrome string:\nA string which reads the same backwards. More formally, A is palindrome if reverse(A) = A.\nIncase of conflict, return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index).\n\n\n\n'
