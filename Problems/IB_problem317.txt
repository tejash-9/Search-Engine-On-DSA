b"Rishabh has a permutation A of N integers 1, 2, ... N but he doesn't like it. Rishabh wants to get a permutation B.\nAlso, Rishabh has some M good pairs given in a form of 2D matrix C of size M x 2  where (C[i][0], C[i][1]) denotes that two indexes of the permutation A.\nIn one operation he can swap Ax and Ay only if (x, y) is a good pair.\nYou have to tell whether Rishabh can obtain permutation B by performing the above operation any number of times on permutation A.\nIf the permutation B can be obtained return 1 else return 0.\n"
