b"You are given a AB character matrix named C. Every cell in C has a character U,R,L or D indicating up,right,left and down.\nYour target is to go from top left corner to the bottom right corner of the matrix.\nBut there are some restrictions while moving along the matrix:\nIf you follow what is written in the cell then you can move freely.\nBut if you don't follow what is written in the cell then you have to pay 1 unit of cost.\nLike: If a cell contains character U and you go right instead of Up you have to pay 1 unit of cost.\nSo your task is to find the minimum cost to go from top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
