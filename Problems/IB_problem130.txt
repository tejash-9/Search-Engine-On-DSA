b'Remove Element\nGiven an array and a value, remove all the instances of that value in the array. \nAlso return the number of elements left in the array after the operation.\nIt does not matter what is left beyond the expected length.\n\nExample:\nIf array A is [4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3]\nand value elem is 1, \nthen new length is 3, and A is now [4, 2, 3]\n\nTry to do it in less than linear additional space complexity.\n'
