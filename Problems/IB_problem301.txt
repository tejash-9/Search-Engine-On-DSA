b'Rishabh takes out his Snakes and Ladders Game, stares the board and wonders: "If I can always roll the die to whatever number I want, what would be the least number of rolls to reach the destination?"\nRULES:\n\nThe game is played with cubic dice of 6 faces numbered from 1 to A.\nStarting from  1 , land on square 100 with the exact roll of the die. If moving the number rolled would place the player beyond square 100, no move is made.\nIf a player lands at the base of a ladder, the player must climb the ladder. Ladders go up only.\nIf a player lands at the mouth of a snake, the player must go down the snake and come out through the tail. Snakes go down only.\n\nBOARD DESCRIPTION:\n\n The board is always 10 x 10  with squares numbered from 1 to 100.\nThe board contains N ladders given in a form of 2D matrix A of size N * 2 where (A[i][0], A[i][1]) denotes a ladder that has its base on square A[i][0] and end at square A[i][1].\n The board contains M snakes given in a form of 2D matrix B of size M * 2 where (B[i][0], B[i][1]) denotes a snake that has its mouth on square B[i][0] and tail at square B[i][1].\n\n\n\n'
