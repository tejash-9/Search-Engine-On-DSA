b'A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or NULL.\nReturn a deep copy of the list.\nExample\nGiven list\n   1 -> 2 -> 3\n\n\nwith random pointers going from\n  1 -> 3\n  2 -> 1\n  3 -> 1\n\n\nYou should return a deep copy of the list. The returned answer should not contain the same node as the original list, but a copy of them. The pointers in the returned list should not link to any node in the original input list.\n'
