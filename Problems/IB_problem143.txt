b'The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:\n\n1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...\n\n1 is read off as one 1 or 11. 11 is read off as two 1s or 21.\n21 is read off as one 2, then one 1 or 1211.\nGiven an integer n, generate the nth sequence.\nNote: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.\nExample:\nif n = 2, the sequence is 11.'
