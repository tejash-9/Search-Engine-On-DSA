b"You are given a string A which is a serialized string. You have to restore the original array of strings.\nThe string in the output array should only have lowercase english alphabets.\nSerialization: Scan each element in a string, calculate its length and append it with a string and a element separator or deliminator (the deliminator is ~). We append the length of the string so that we know the length of each element.\nFor example, for a string 'interviewbit', its serialized version would be 'interviewbit12~'."
