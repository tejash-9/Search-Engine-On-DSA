b'Given a positive integer n and a string s consisting only of letters D or I, you have to find any permutation of first n positive integer that satisfy the given input string.\nD means the next number is smaller, while I means the next number is greater.\nNotes\n\nLength of given string s will always equal to n - 1\nYour solution should run in linear time and space.\n\nExample :\nInput 1:\n\nn = 3\n\ns = ID\n\nReturn: [1, 3, 2]\n\n\n\n'
