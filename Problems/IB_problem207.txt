b'Given a 2 x N grid of integer, A, choose numbers such that the sum of the numbers\nis maximum and no two chosen numbers are adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and return it.\nNote: You can choose more than 2 numbers.\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument of input contains a 2d matrix, A.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer, representing the maximum possible sum.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= N <= 20000\n1 <= A[i] <= 2000\n\n\nExample:\nInput 1:\n    A = [   [1]\n            [2]    ]\n\nOutput 1:\n    2\n\nExplanation 1:\n    We will choose 2.\n\nInput 2:\n    A = [   [1, 2, 3, 4]\n            [2, 3, 4, 5]    ]\n    \nOutput 2:\n    We will choose 3 and 5.\n\n\n'
