b"Given a character matrix of size N x M in the form of a string array A of size N where A[i] denotes ith row.\nEach character in the matrix consists any one of the following three characters {'r', 'g', 'b'} where 'r' denotes red color similarly 'g' denotes green color and 'b' denotes blue color.\nYou have to find the area of the largest triangle that has one side parallel to y-axis i.e vertical and the color of all three vertices are different.\nNOTE:\n\n\nIf the area comes out to be a real number than return the ceil of that number.\n\n\n\n\n"
