b'Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.\n\nNote: You have to modify the array A to contain the merge of A and B. Do not output anything in your code.\nTIP: C users, please malloc the result into a new array and return the result.\n\nIf the number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively, the resulting size of array A after your code is executed should be m + n\nExample :\nInput : \n         A : [1 5 8]\n         B : [6 9]\n\nModified A : [1 5 6 8 9]\n\n\n'
