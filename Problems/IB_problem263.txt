b'Given three sorted arrays A, B  and Cof not necessarily same sizes.\nCalculate the minimum absolute difference between the maximum and minimum number from the triplet a, b, c such that a, b, c belongs arrays A, B, C respectively.\ni.e. minimize | max(a,b,c) - min(a,b,c) |.\nExample :\nInput:\nA : [ 1, 4, 5, 8, 10 ]\nB : [ 6, 9, 15 ]\nC : [ 2, 3, 6, 6 ]\n\n\nOutput:\n1\n\n\nExplanation: We get the minimum difference for a=5, b=6, c=6 as | max(a,b,c) - min(a,b,c) | = |6-5| = 1.\n'
