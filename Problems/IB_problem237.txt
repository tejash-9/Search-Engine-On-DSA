b'You are given an integer N. You have to find smallest multiple of N which consists of digits 0 and 1 only. Since this multiple could be large, return it in form of a string.\nNote:\n\nReturned string should not contain leading zeroes.\n\nFor example,\nFor N = 55, 110 is smallest multiple consisting of digits 0 and 1.\nFor N = 2, 10 is the answer.\n\n\n'
