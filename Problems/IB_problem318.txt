b'Given a undirected tree with N nodes labeled  from 1 to N.\nEach node has a certain weight assigned to it given by an integer array A of size N.\nYou need to delete an edge in such a way that Product between sum of weight of nodes in one subtree with sum of weight of nodes in other subtree is maximized.\nReturn this maximum possible product modulo 109 + 7.\nNOTE:\nThe tree is rooted at node labeled  with 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
