b'Given two words A and B, and a dictionary, C, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from A to B, such that:\n\nYou must change exactly one character in every transformation.\nEach intermediate word must exist in the dictionary.\n\nNote:\n\nReturn 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.\nAll words have the same length.\nAll words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.\n\n\nInput Format:\nThe first argument of input contains a string, A.\nThe second argument of input contains a string, B.\nThe third argument of input contains an array of strings, C.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer representing the minimum number of steps required to change string A to string B.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= length(A), length(B), length(C[i]) <= 25\n1 <= length(C) <= 5e3\n\n\nExample :\nInput 1:\n    A = "hit"\n    B = "cog"\n    C = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log"]\n\nOutput 1:\n    5\n\nExplanation 1:\n    "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"\n\n\n'
