b'The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.\nGiven a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.\nFor example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:\n00 - 0\n01 - 1\n11 - 3\n10 - 2\n\n\nThere might be multiple gray code sequences possible for a given n.\nReturn any such sequence.\n'
