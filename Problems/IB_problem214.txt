b'There are N Mice and N holes that are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse.\nThe positions of Mice are denoted by array A and the position of holes are denoted by array B.\nA mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x \xe2\x88\x92 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.\nAssign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.\n\n\n'
