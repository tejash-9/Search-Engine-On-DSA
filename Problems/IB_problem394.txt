b'You are travelling to Neverland. After a long journey, you decided to take rest in a hotel for a night.\nYou have the map of Neverland in the form of 2D matrix A with dimensions N x M. \nThe rows are numbered from 1 to N, and the columns are numbered from 1 to M.\nYou can travel from one cell to any adjacent cell. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.\nIn the map, there are only two digits, 0 and 1, \nwhere 1 denotes a hotel in that cell, and 0 denotes an empty cell.\nYou are also given another 2D array B with dimension Q x 2, \nwhere each row denotes a co-ordinate (X, Y) on the map (1 - indexed). \nFor each coordinate you have to find the distance to the nearest hotel.\nReturn an array denoting the answer to each coordinate in the array B.'
