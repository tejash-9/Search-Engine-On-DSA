b'Given an integer array A containing N integers.\nYou need to divide the array A into two subsets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.\nFind and return this minimum possible absolute difference.\nNOTE:\nSubsets can contain elements from A in any order (not necessary to be contiguous).\nEach element of A should belong to any one subset S1 or S2, not both.\nIt may be possible that one subset remains empty.'
