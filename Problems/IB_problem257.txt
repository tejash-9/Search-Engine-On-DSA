b'Given a 3 x A board,  find the number of ways to color it using at most 4 colors such that no 2 adjacent boxes have same color.\nDiagonal neighbors are not treated as adjacent boxes.\nReturn the ways modulo 109 + 7 as the answer grows quickly.\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument contains an integer, A.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer representing the number of ways to color the board.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= A < 100000\n\n\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    A = 1\n\nOutput 1:\n    36\n\nInput 2:\n    A = 2\n\nOutput 2:\n    588\n\n\n'
