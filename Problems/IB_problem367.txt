b'There is a rectangular field with two types of resources viz, resource A and resource B. At each cell in the field, both of \nthe resources can be present. There are two types of factories which can collect resource A and B. If resource A is collected \nin a factory then resource B is lost and vice versa. Now, these two factories are located perpendicular to each other i.e the \nfactory collecting resource A is at the top ( north) of the rectangular field and the factory collecting resource B is to the \nleft ( west) of the rectangular field. The resources have to be brought to the factory on a straight path without taking any \nturns. This implies that if there is any south-north conveyor belt in the cell, but the cell north of it contains an east-west \nconveyor belt, then all resources transported on the south-north conveyor belt will be lost.\nYou have to design a conveyor belt system that maximizes the total amount of minerals mined, i.e the sum of the amount of \nresource A transported to the top and the sum of the amount of resource B transported to the left. You are given a 2-D matrix \nA and B of the same size denoting the amount of resource of the corresponding type in that \ncell.\nSince the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\n'
