b'Given an directed graph having A nodes. A matrix B of size M x 2 is given which represents the M edges such that there is a edge directed from node B[i][0] to node B[i][1].\nFind whether the graph contains a cycle or not, return 1 if cycle is present else return 0.\nNOTE:\n\nThe cycle must contain atleast two nodes.\nThere are no self-loops in the graph.\nThere are no multiple edges between two nodes.\nThe graph may or may not be connected.\nNodes are numbered from 1 to A.\nYour solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.\n\n\n\n'
