b'Given an integer array A with distinct elements, which represents the preorder traversal of a binary search tree, \nconstruct the tree and return its root.\nA binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of Node.left has a value strictly less than Node.val, and any descendant of Node.right has a value strictly greater than Node.val.\nA preorder traversal of a binary tree displays the value of the node first, then traverses Node.left, then traverses Node.right.'
