b'Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find the shortest transformation sequence from start to end, such that:\n\n\nOnly one letter can be changed at a time\nEach intermediate word must exist in the dictionary\n\n\nIf there are multiple such sequence of shortest length, return all of them. Refer to the example for more details.\nNote:\n\n\nAll words have the same length.\nAll words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.\n\n\nInput Format\nThe first argument is string start.\nThe second argument is string end.\nThe third argument is an array of strings dict\n\n\nOutput Format\nReturn all transformation sequences such that first word of each sequence is start and last word is end, all intermediate words belongs to dictionary(dict) and consecutive words had atmost 1 difference.  \n\n\nExample :\n:\nstart = "hit"\nend = "cog"\ndict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]\n\n\nReturn\n  [\n    ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],\n    ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]\n  ]\n  \n\n\n'
