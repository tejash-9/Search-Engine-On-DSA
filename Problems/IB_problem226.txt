b"Given a string, find the rank of the string amongst its permutations sorted lexicographically. \nNote that the characters might be repeated. If the characters are repeated, we need to look at the rank in unique permutations. \nLook at the example for more details.\nExample :\nInput : 'aba'\nOutput : 2\n\nThe order permutations with letters 'a', 'a', and 'b' : \naab\naba\nbaa\n\n\nThe answer might not fit in an integer, so return your answer % 1000003\n\nNOTE: 1000003 is a prime number\nNOTE: Assume the number of characters in string < 1000003\n\n"
