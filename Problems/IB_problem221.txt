b'Given an even number ( greater than 2 ), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number.\nNOTE A solution will always exist. read Goldbach\xe2\x80\x99s  conjecture\nExample:\n\nInput : 4\nOutput: 2 + 2 = 4\n\n\n\nIf there are more than one solutions possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.\nIf [a, b] is one solution with a <= b,\nand [c,d] is another solution with c <= d, then\n\n[a, b] < [c, d] \n\nIf a < c OR a==c AND b < d. \n\n\n'
