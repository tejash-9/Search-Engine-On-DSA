b'Given a singly linked list and an integer K, reverses the nodes of the\nlist K at a time and returns modified linked list.\n\nNOTE : The length of the list is divisible by K\n\nExample :\nGiven linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 and K=2,\nYou should return 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5\nTry to solve the problem using constant extra space.\n'
