b'Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.\n\n\nIf version1 > version2 return 1,\nIf version1 < version2 return -1,\notherwise return 0.\n\n\nYou may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.\nThe . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.\nFor instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.\nHere is an example of version numbers ordering:\n0.1 < 1.1 < 1.2 < 1.13 < 1.13.4\n\n\n'
