b'Given an expression, A, with operands and operators (OR , AND , XOR), in how many ways can you evaluate the expression to true, by grouping in different ways?\nOperands are only true and false.\nReturn the number of ways to evaluate the expression modulo 103 + 3.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument of input will contain a string, A.\n\nThe string A, may contain these characters:\n    \'|\' will represent or operator \n    \'&\' will represent and operator\n    \'^\' will represent xor operator\n    \'T\' will represent true operand\n    \'F\' will false\n\n\nOutput:\nReturn an integer, representing the number of ways to evaluate the string.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= length(A) <= 150\n\n\nExample:\nInput 1:\n    A = "T|F"\n\nOutput 1:\n    1\n\nExplanation 1:\n    The only way to evaluate the expression is:\n        => (T|F) = T \n\nInput 2:\n    A = "T^T^F"\n    \nOutput 2:\n    0\n    \nExplanation 2:\n    There is no way to evaluate A to a true statement.\n\n\n'
