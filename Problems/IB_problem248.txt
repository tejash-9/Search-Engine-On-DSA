b"Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists of N nodes.\nThe goal of the problem is to find largest distance between two nodes in a tree.\nDistance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the nodes (there will be a unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree).\nThe nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.\nThe tree is given as an array A, there is an edge between nodes A[i] and i (0 <= i < N). Exactly one of the i's will have A[i] equal to -1, it will be root node.\n"
