b'Find the intersection of two sorted arrays. OR in other words, Given 2 sorted arrays, find all the elements which occur in both the arrays.\nExample:\nInput:\n    A: [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]\n    B: [3 3 5]\n\nOutput: [3 3 5]\n\nInput:\n    A: [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]\n    B: [3 5]\n\nOutput: [3 5]\n\nNOTE : For the purpose of this problem ( as also conveyed by the sample case ), assume that elements that appear more than once in both arrays should be included multiple times in the final output.
