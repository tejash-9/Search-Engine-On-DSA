b'Given an array of integers,  sort the array into a wave like array and return it, \nIn other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that  a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5.....\nExample\nGiven [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nOne possible answer : [2, 1, 4, 3]\nAnother possible answer : [4, 1, 3, 2]\n\n\n\nNOTE : If there are multiple answers possible, return the one thats lexicographically smallest. \nSo, in example case, you will return [2, 1, 4, 3]\n\n'
