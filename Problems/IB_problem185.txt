b'Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.\nExample :\nGiven the below binary tree and sum = 22,\n              5\n             / \\\n            4   8\n           /   / \\\n          11  13  4\n         /  \\      \\\n        7    2      1\n\n\nreturn true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.\nReturn 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem\n'
