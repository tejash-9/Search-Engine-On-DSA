b'Given a set of reviews provided by the customers for different hotels and a string containing Good Words, you need to sort the reviews in descending order according to their Goodness Value (Higher goodness value first). We define the Goodness Value of a string as the number of Good Words in that string.\nNOTE: Sorting should be stable. If review i and review j have the same Goodness Value then their original order would be preserved.\nYou are expected to use Trie in an Interview for such problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
