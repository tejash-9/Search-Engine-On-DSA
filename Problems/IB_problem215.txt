b"Given N x M character matrix A of O's and X's, where O = white, X = black.\nReturn the number of black shapes. A black shape consists of one or more adjacent X's (diagonals not included)\n\nInput Format:\n    The First and only argument is a N x M character matrix.\n\n\nOutput Format:\n    Return a single integer denoting number of black shapes.\n\n\nConstraints:\n    1 <= N,M <= 1000\n    A[i][j] = 'X' or 'O'\n\n\nExample:\nInput 1:\n    A = [ OOOXOOO\n          OOXXOXO\n          OXOOOXO  ]\nOutput 1:\n    3\nExplanation:\n    3 shapes are  :\n    (i)    X\n         X X\n    (ii)\n          X\n    (iii)\n          X\n          X\n\n\nNote: we are looking for connected shapes here.\nXXX\nXXX\nXXX\n\n\nis just one single connected black shape.\n"
