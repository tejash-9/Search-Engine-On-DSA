b'Given an array, find the nearest smaller element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array such that the element has an index smaller than i.\nMore formally,\n    G[i] for an element A[i] = an element A[j] such that \n    j is maximum possible AND \n    j < i AND\n    A[j] < A[i]\n\n\nElements for which no smaller element exist, consider next smaller element as -1.\nInput Format\nThe only argument given is integer array A.\n\n\nOutput Format\nReturn the integar array G such that G[i] contains nearest smaller number than A[i].If no such element occurs G[i] should be -1.\n\n\nFor Example\nInput 1:\n    A = [4, 5, 2, 10, 8]\nOutput 1:\n    G = [-1, 4, -1, 2, 2]\nExplaination 1:\n    index 1: No element less than 4 in left of 4, G[1] = -1\n    index 2: A[1] is only element less than A[2], G[2] = A[1]\n    index 3: No element less than 2 in left of 2, G[3] = -1\n    index 4: A[3] is nearest element which is less than A[4], G[4] = A[3]\n    index 4: A[3] is nearest element which is less than A[5], G[5] = A[3]\n    \nInput 2:\n    A = [3, 2, 1]\nOutput 2:\n    [-1, -1, -1]\nExplaination 2:\n    index 1: No element less than 3 in left of 3, G[1] = -1\n    index 2: No element less than 2 in left of 2, G[2] = -1\n    index 3: No element less than 1 in left of 1, G[3] = -1\n\n\n'
