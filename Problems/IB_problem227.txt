b'You are given a set of coins S. In how many ways can you make sum N assuming you have infinite amount of each coin in the set.\nNote : Coins in set S will be unique. Expected space complexity of this problem is O(N).\nExample :\nInput : \n\tS = [1, 2, 3] \n\tN = 4\n\nReturn : 4\n\nExplanation : The 4 possible ways are\n{1, 1, 1, 1}\n{1, 1, 2}\n{2, 2}\n{1, 3}\t\n\n\nNote that the answer can overflow. So, give us the answer % 1000007\n'
