b'Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.\nThe word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The cell itself does not count as an adjacent cell. \nThe same letter cell may be used more than once.\nExample :\nGiven board =\n[\n  ["ABCE"],\n  ["SFCS"],\n  ["ADEE"]\n]\n\n\nword = "ABCCED", -> returns 1,\nword = "SEE", -> returns 1,\nword = "ABCB", -> returns 1,\nword = "ABFSAB" -> returns 1\nword = "ABCD" -> returns 0\n\n\nNote that 1 corresponds to true, and 0 corresponds to false.\n'
