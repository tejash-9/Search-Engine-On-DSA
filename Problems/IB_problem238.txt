b'Given a number A, return number of ways you can draw A chords in a circle with 2 x A points such that no 2 chords intersect.\nTwo ways are different if there exists a chord which is present in one way and not in other.\nReturn the answer modulo 109 + 7.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first and the only argument contains the integer A.\n\n\nOutput Format:\nReturn an integer answering the query as described in the problem statement.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1 <= A <= 1000\n\n\nExamples:\nInput 1:\n    A = 1\n\nOutput 1:\n    1\n\nExplanation 1:\n    If points are numbered 1 to 2 in clockwise direction, then different ways to draw chords are:\n    {(1-2)} only.\n    So, we return 1.\n\nInput 2:\n    A = 2\n\nOutput 2:\n    2\n\nExplanation 2:\n    If points are numbered 1 to 4 in clockwise direction, then different ways to draw chords are:\n    {(1-2), (3-4)} and {(1-4), (2-3)}.\n    So, we return 2.\n\n\n'
