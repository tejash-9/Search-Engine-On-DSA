b'Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.\nAn example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.\nFind the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers % 1003.\nExample :\n    1\n   / \\\n  2   3\n\n\nThe root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.\nThe root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.\nReturn the sum = (12 + 13) % 1003 = 25 % 1003 = 25.\n'
