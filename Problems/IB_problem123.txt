b'Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. \nReturn the sum of the three integers.\nAssume that there will only be one solution\nExample: \ngiven array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, \nand target = 1.\nThe sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)\n'
