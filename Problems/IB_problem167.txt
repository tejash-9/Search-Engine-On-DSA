b'Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.\nTell us the 2 values swapping which the tree will be restored.\n\nNote:\nA solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?\n\nExample :\n\nInput : \n         1\n        / \\\n       2   3\n\nOutput : \n       [1, 2]\n\nExplanation : Swapping 1 and 2 will change the BST to be \n         2\n        / \\\n       1   3\nwhich is a valid BST          \n\n\n'
