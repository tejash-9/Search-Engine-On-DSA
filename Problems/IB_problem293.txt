b'Given an undirected graph having A nodes labelled from 1 to A with M edges given in a form of matrix B of size M x 2 where (B[i][0], B[i][1]) represents two nodes B[i][0] and B[i][1] connected by an edge.\nFind whether the graph contains a cycle or not, return 1 if cycle is present else return 0.\nNOTE:\n\nThe cycle must contain atleast three nodes.\nThere are no self-loops in the graph.\nThere are no multiple edges between two nodes.\nThe graph may or may not be connected.\nNodes are numbered from 1 to A.\nYour solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.\n\n\n\n\n'
