b'Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.\nCollege library has N bags,the ith book has A[i] number of pages.\nYou have to allocate books to B number of students so that maximum number of pages alloted to a student is minimum.\nA book will be allocated to exactly one student.\nEach student has to be allocated at least one book.\nAllotment should be in contiguous order, for example: A student cannot be allocated book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2.\n\n\nCalculate and return that minimum possible number.\nNOTE: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible.\n\nInput Format\nThe first argument given is the integer array A.\nThe second argument given is the integer B.\n\n\nOutput Format\nReturn that minimum possible number\n\n\nConstraints\n1 <= N <= 10^5\n1 <= A[i] <= 10^5\n\n\nFor Example\nInput 1:\n    A = [12, 34, 67, 90]\n    B = 2\nOutput 1:\n    113\nExplanation 1:\n    There are 2 number of students. Books can be distributed in following fashion : \n        1) [12] and [34, 67, 90]\n        Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 34 + 67 + 90 = 191 pages\n        2) [12, 34] and [67, 90]\n        Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 67 + 90 = 157 pages \n        3) [12, 34, 67] and [90]\n        Max number of pages is allocated to student 1 with 12 + 34 + 67 = 113 pages\n\n        Of the 3 cases, Option 3 has the minimum pages = 113.\n\nInput 2:\n    A = [5, 17, 100, 11]\n    B = 4\nOutput 2:\n    100\n\n\n'
